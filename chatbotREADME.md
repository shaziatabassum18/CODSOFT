📌 Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
Welcome to my mini project — a rule-based chatbot built using Python!
This project is a beginner-friendly exploration into the world of Natural Language Processing and Conversational AI, designed to simulate basic human interaction using predefined logic and keyword matching.

💡 Project Overview - 
This chatbot mimics simple conversation by identifying specific keywords in user input and responding with predefined messages. The focus here is on understanding how early chatbot systems were designed before the rise of machine learning and NLP libraries.

🎯 Objectives - 
To design a basic chatbot capable of carrying on a structured conversation

To demonstrate the use of conditional logic and string processing in Python

To gain hands-on experience in the fundamentals of AI-powered conversation

⚙️ Technologies & Tools - 
Language: Python 🐍

Editor: Visual Studio Code

Core Concepts: If-Else Logic, String Manipulation, User Input Handling

🚀 Features - 
Handles simple conversations like greetings, queries, and farewells

Case-insensitive input processing

Terminates upon detecting exit keywords like “bye”

Easy to expand with new rules and keywords

🛠️ How It Works - 
The chatbot runs a continuous loop to receive input from the user.

The input is converted to lowercase for consistent matching.

It checks for predefined keywords using if-else statements.

A matched keyword triggers a specific response.

The chat continues until a termination word (like "bye") is entered.

📈 Future Scope - 
This rule-based design lays the groundwork for more advanced bots. Here’s how it could evolve:

Upgrade to regular expression matching for flexible input handling

Integrate NLP libraries like spaCy or NLTK for better understanding

Transition to Machine Learning or Deep Learning for smart, learning-based responses
