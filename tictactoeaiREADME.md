🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI — Unbeatable Game Agent Using Minimax
Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe AI, a mini project designed to bring classic strategy to life with artificial intelligence. Built in Python, this intelligent agent plays Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player using the Minimax algorithm, making it virtually impossible to beat.

💡 Project Overview - 
This project showcases the implementation of a recursive, decision-making AI that evaluates all possible moves to always choose the optimal one. It’s a clean example of applying game theory and fundamental AI algorithms in a real game environment.

🎯 Objectives - 
Design a game-playing AI agent using the Minimax algorithm

Understand recursive algorithms and decision trees in turn-based strategy games

Explore fundamental AI principles through classic game design

⚙️ Technology Stack - 
Language: Python 🐍

Editor: Visual Studio Code

Algorithm: Minimax (no Alpha-Beta pruning yet)

🧠 How It Works - 
The game board is a simple 3x3 matrix.

Human plays as 'X', AI plays as 'O'.

AI uses Minimax to recursively simulate every possible outcome.

It selects the move with the best outcome — winning or forcing a draw.

The game ends with a win, loss, or draw — but the AI never loses.

📐 Project Architecture - 
Game Engine – Handles board logic, player input, and rendering.

Minimax Function – Explores all possible future game states.

AI Logic – Evaluates the best move based on Minimax scoring.

🚀 Future Scope - 
✅ Add Alpha-Beta Pruning for improved efficiency

✅ Build a GUI using Tkinter or Pygame

✅ Extend for multiplayer or online gameplay

🧠 Learning Outcome - 
This project strengthened my understanding of:

Recursive problem solving

AI in deterministic games

Practical implementation of game theory
